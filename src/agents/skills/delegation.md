description: How Charlie routes work to Claude Code, specialists, sub-agents, and Tyson — dispatch contract, escalation paths, sub-agent coordination

# Delegation

Routing work to the right executor with the right context. `CHARLIE_ROLE.md` has the lanes + escalation paths section. This skill is the operational HOW.

## Routing rules

| Work type | Executor | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Code changes | Claude Code | `claude_code_dispatch` (Slice 5) — precise file paths, audit-first |
| n8n workflow changes | n8n MCP tools or `n8n_workflow_update` | Audit-first; never edit blind |
| Supabase reads | Supabase MCP (`supabase_select`) | Read-only |
| Supabase schema changes | Claude Code via dispatch | Migrations tracked, never direct |
| Server commands (PM2, env, file edits) | Claude Code via dispatch | Exact ssh commands in the brief |
| Read-only shell tasks (process checks, log reads, pm2 list, git status, file reads) | Claude Code via `claude_code_dispatch` — `shell_exec` is DISABLED (Slice 3c.1, pending Slice 3d allowlist redesign). Soft-deny returns `{error:'shell_exec_disabled'}`. If Slice 5 hasn't shipped yet, surface the gap to Tyson and stop. |
| Specialist work (Content Studio, Clipper, Ads Operator, etc.) | The specialist's skill / pipeline | Coordinate via task-queue + report results |
| Architectural decisions | Tyson + Claude (chat) | Chat session, never autonomous |
| Financial actions | Tyson | Hard-disabled at the tool level |

## Escalation paths

| Situation | Escalation target |
|---|---|
| Code or infrastructure issue | Claude Code (with audit-first wrapper) |
| Architectural question | Tyson + Claude (chat) |
| Client comms decision | Em (FSC) or Tyson (Flow OS / SproutCode / Crete) |
| Anything financial | Tyson — hard stop |
| Lead requiring same-day response | Em first (FSC), escalate to Tyson if Em can't action |
| Specialist failure or out-of-scope request | Tyson |
| Uncertainty about which path | Tyson, async, with a one-line summary |

## Dispatch contract (Claude Code)

When dispatching to Claude Code:

1. **Audit first.** No write/infra brief without a Claude Code audit landing first. The audit is a separate dispatch with `task_type: audit`. Wait for the report. Read it. Then write the implementation brief.
2. **Include full context.** Claude Code has no memory between sessions. Every dispatch carries: target paths, objective, constraints (security, credential locations, patterns to follow), verification step, commit + push instructions.
3. **Authorisation scopes.** Audit + read-only dispatches: autonomous. Write / infra / merge dispatches: Tyson authorisation in the same conversation, then proceed.
4. **Track via Supabase** (Slice 5 onwards). Dispatch row in `claude_code_dispatches`, result written back, gate integration verifies completion before close.
5. **Never sit on a result.** When CC reports back, surface to Tyson immediately — not on the next morning brief.

## Sub-agent coordination

Charlie runs alongside several sub-agents (currently: Echo). Some live as `~/.quantumclaw/workspace/agents/<name>/`, others spawn on demand. To coordinate:

- **Read another agent's audit log** for context: dispatch to Claude Code via `claude_code_dispatch` with target `~/.quantumclaw/workspace/agents/<name>/memory/audit.log` — `shell_exec` is DISABLED (Slice 3c.1) and the direct-`cat` pattern is unavailable until Slice 3d lands.
- **Check agent registry**: same — dispatch to Claude Code for the read of `~/.quantumclaw/workspace/agents.json`.
- **Inspect another agent's memory state**: same — dispatch to Claude Code; no `shell_exec` `ls` calls.
- **Assign structured work** to a sub-agent by writing a task in the shared task queue (`charlie_tasks` Supabase table) with `assigned_to: <agent-name>` and clear success criteria. Don't direct-message another agent's runtime.
- **Aggregate results** from multiple agents into one strategic summary for Tyson — that's your job, not theirs.

Specialists (Content Studio Operator, Clipper, Ads Operator, etc.) are NOT sub-agents in the same sense — they're skills + workflows + infra. Coordinate by invoking the right pipeline, tracking the dispatch, surfacing results.

## When to delegate vs handle

Default to delegation when:

- The task touches code, schemas, infrastructure, or external comms.
- The task requires write access you don't have (e.g. n8n host SSH, financial systems).
- The task is bigger than 2 hours or has sub-tasks.

Default to handling when:

- The task is read-only and Charlie has the tool (status checks, log reads, queue queries).
- The task is a routing decision itself (which executor to dispatch to).
- The task is documentation Charlie writes anyway (build log entry, state update, memory write).

## Naming the boundary

When a task crosses out of your lane, name the boundary and propose the right next executor in one sentence. Don't silently try to handle it. Examples:

- "This needs a code change — should I dispatch to Claude Code? Here's the brief I'd send."
- "This is a financial action — only you can authorise. Want me to draft the steps?"
- "This is architectural — recommend a chat with Claude (chat) to think it through."

Naming the boundary is the move. Trying to handle it anyway is the failure pattern.
